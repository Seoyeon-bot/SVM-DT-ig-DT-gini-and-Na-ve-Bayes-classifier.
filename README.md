# Data Mining 
To analyze the effect of different values of ψ and ϵ on cross-entropy values across iterations, 
as well as the average training and testing errors,  trained a linear SVM model on the cancer dataset. 
Subsequently, plotted the change in cross-entropy values over iterations and calculated the average training and testing errors. 
Moreover,examined the losses and number of iterations to draw conclusions. 
Finally,evaluated the model's performance using F-measure and the confusion matrix.
